# World Happiness Report Models 🌎
## Goal 🎯: Predict a whether a person's 'Life Ladder' score is above 5.0 or below 5.0 based on their responses to other categories.
## Process 📓
1) Built a dataframe using Pandas
2) Designed a supervised machine learning problem(binary classification)
3) Analyzed the dataset by checking data types, null values, rough stats, correlation between label and features, and label values
4) Defined the project plan by narrowing down the features list, determining appropriate models to implement, and finalizing model performace metrics
5) Implemented project plan
   - Prepped data by selecting appropriate features, addressing missing values, and finding and handling outliers
   - Implemented and optimized a logisitic regression, decision tree, and neural network
   - Analyzed results from all 3 models to determine the best-performing model

Check out the World Happiness Report data set I used : WHR_dataset.csv
## Outcome ⭐: Logisitic regression was the best performing model! Reached an accuracy of 0.872 and a loss of 0.303!
